The dataset is taken from UCI machine learning repository. I have carried out a classification project which deals with the prediction of diabeties. 

Steps which I have carried out
1. Feature analysis is performed first like data cleaning and removing outliers, null values, duplicates.
2. The correlation matrix is generated and a heatmap is plotted as a part of EDA.
3. Using matplotlib library the data with different features is plotted using bar graphs, scatter plots, histograms for better understanding of the data
4. Feature scaling operation is performed to normalize the range of independent features which is a pre-processing step.
5. Different ML algorithms(7) are trained on the dataset and the outputs are predicted.
6. Accuracy score of each model is calculated and subsequently the k fold cross validation is performed.
7. The confusion matrix is plotted for each model and the classification report is generated.
